- **Key Structures**: Bones, lungs, heart, organs

### Day 3: Medical Terminology
- **Word Construction**: Prefix + Root + Suffix
- **Common Prefixes**: Cardio-, Osteo-, Hepato-, etc.
- **Common Roots**: Arthr-, Bronch-, Gastr-, etc.
- **Common Suffixes**: -itis, -osis, -ectomy, etc.

### Day 4: Patient Care Fundamentals
- **Communication**: 5 C's (Clear, Concise, Complete, Courteous, Correct)
- **Safety**: ALARA principle, infection control, patient identification
- **Patient Rights**: HIPAA, privacy, cultural sensitivity
- **Emergency Response**: Recognizing and responding to emergencies

### Day 5: X-ray Physics Basics
- **X-ray Production**: Cathode, anode, vacuum, high voltage
- **Interactions**: Photoelectric effect (most important), Compton scatter
- **Image Formation**: Differential absorption creates contrast
- **Radiation Safety**: Time, distance, shielding

## üéØ Key Concepts to Master

### **Anatomical Directional Terms**:
- **Anterior/Posterior**: Front/back
- **Superior/Inferior**: Above/below
- **Medial/Lateral**: Toward/away from center
- **Proximal/Distal**: Closer to/farther from trunk

### **Medical Term Building**:
- **Cardiomegaly**: Cardio (heart) + -megaly (enlargement) = enlarged heart
- **Osteoarthritis**: Osteo (bone) + Arthr (joint) + -itis (inflammation)
- **Pneumonitis**: Pneumo (lung) + -itis (inflammation)

### **X-ray Physics**:
- **kVp**: Controls X-ray energy (higher = more penetrating)
- **mA**: Controls X-ray quantity
- **mAs**: Total exposure (mA √ó time)
- **Photoelectric Effect**: Creates image contrast

### **Patient Safety**:
- **ALARA**: As Low As Reasonably Achievable
- **Two-Patient Identifier**: Name + Date of birth
- **HIPAA**: Patient privacy protection

## üìù Practice Questions

### **Anatomy & Physiology**:
1. What color do bones appear on X-rays and why?
2. Name the four chambers of the heart
3. What body system is most commonly imaged with X-rays?
4. How do lungs appear on a chest X-ray?

### **Medical Terminology**:
1. Break down the term "gastroenteritis"
2. What does "cardiovascular" mean?
3. Create a medical term for "inflammation of the liver"
4. What does the suffix "-ectomy" mean?

### **Patient Care**:
1. What are the 5 C's of communication?
2. What does ALARA stand for?
3. How do you verify patient identification?
4. What should you do if a patient has an emergency?

### **X-ray Physics**:
1. What are the three main factors that control X-ray production?
2. Which X-ray interaction is most important for image formation?
3. How do you protect yourself from radiation exposure?
4. What affects image contrast?

## üîó Quick Reference

### **Common Medical Prefixes**:
- Cardio- = heart
- Osteo- = bone
- Hepato- = liver
- Pneumo- = lung
- Gastro- = stomach

### **Common Medical Suffixes**:
- -itis = inflammation
- -osis = condition/disease
- -ectomy = surgical removal
- -megaly = enlargement
- -algia = pain

### **X-ray Equipment Terms**:
- kVp = kilovoltage peak
- mA = milliamperage
- mAs = milliampere-seconds
- Collimator = limits X-ray beam
- Cassette = holds film/detector

### **Safety Acronyms**:
- ALARA = As Low As Reasonably Achievable
- HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- PPE = Personal Protective Equipment

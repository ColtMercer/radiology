# Day 5: X-ray Physics Basics

**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Topic**: Understanding How X-rays Work - The Science Behind the Images

## üéØ Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you will:
- Understand what X-rays are and how they're produced
- Learn how X-rays interact with different materials
- Understand the relationship between X-ray energy and image quality
- Learn basic radiation safety principles

## ‚ö° What Are X-rays?

X-rays are a form of **electromagnetic radiation** - the same family as visible light, radio waves, and microwaves.

### **Key Characteristics**:
- **High Energy**: Much more energetic than visible light
- **Short Wavelength**: Can pass through many materials
- **Invisible**: Cannot be seen with the naked eye
- **Ionizing**: Can remove electrons from atoms

### **Discovery**:
- Discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895
- Named "X" because they were unknown at the time
- First medical X-ray was of his wife's hand

## üî¨ How X-rays Are Produced

### **X-ray Tube Components**:
1. **Cathode**: Negatively charged electrode
2. **Anode**: Positively charged electrode (target)
3. **Vacuum**: Air removed from tube
4. **High Voltage**: Creates electrical potential

### **Production Process**:
1. **Electron Generation**: Cathode heats up, releases electrons
2. **Acceleration**: High voltage pulls electrons toward anode
3. **Collision**: Electrons hit anode target (usually tungsten)
4. **X-ray Production**: Energy conversion creates X-rays
5. **Emission**: X-rays exit through window in tube

### **Key Factors**:
- **kVp** (kilovoltage peak): Controls X-ray energy
- **mA** (milliamperage): Controls quantity of X-rays
- **Time**: Duration of exposure
- **mAs**: mA √ó time = total exposure

## üéØ X-ray Interactions with Matter

### **Five Types of Interactions**:

#### **1. Coherent Scatter**:
- Low energy X-rays
- Changes direction but not energy
- Minimal effect on image

#### **2. Photoelectric Effect**:
- X-ray absorbed by atom
- Electron ejected from atom
- **Most important for image formation**
- Creates contrast between tissues

#### **3. Compton Scatter**:
- X-ray hits electron, changes direction
- Reduces image quality
- Creates radiation scatter

#### **4. Pair Production**:
- High energy X-rays only
- Creates electron-positron pair
- Rare in diagnostic imaging

#### **5. Photodisintegration**:
- Very high energy X-rays
- Breaks apart atomic nucleus
- Not relevant to diagnostic imaging

## üñºÔ∏è How Images Are Created

### **Differential Absorption**:
Different tissues absorb X-rays differently:

#### **High Absorption (White on image)**:
- **Bone**: Calcium makes it dense
- **Metal**: Implants, jewelry
- **Contrast media**: Iodine, barium

#### **Medium Absorption (Gray on image)**:
- **Muscle**: Moderate density
- **Organs**: Liver, heart, kidneys
- **Fluid**: Blood, water

#### **Low Absorption (Dark on image)**:
- **Air**: Lungs, stomach
- **Fat**: Adipose tissue
- **Gas**: In intestines

## ‚öôÔ∏è X-ray Equipment Components

### **X-ray Tube**:
- **Glass envelope**: Contains vacuum
- **Cathode**: Electron source
- **Anode**: Target for electron collision
- **Window**: X-rays exit here

### **Control Panel**:
- **kVp selector**: Controls X-ray energy
- **mA selector**: Controls X-ray quantity
- **Timer**: Controls exposure duration
- **Exposure button**: Initiates X-ray production

### **Image Receptor**:
- **Digital detector**: Modern systems
- **Film/screen**: Traditional systems
- **Cassette**: Holds film or detector

## üõ°Ô∏è Radiation Safety

### **ALARA Principle**:
- **A**s **L**ow **A**s **R**easonably **A**chievable
- Always minimize radiation exposure

### **Time, Distance, Shielding**:
1. **Time**: Minimize exposure time
2. **Distance**: Stay as far as possible from X-ray source
3. **Shielding**: Use lead aprons, walls, barriers

### **Patient Protection**:
- **Collimation**: Limit X-ray beam to area of interest
- **Shielding**: Use lead aprons on sensitive areas
- **Proper technique**: Use correct exposure factors
- **Justification**: Only image when medically necessary

### **Staff Protection**:
- **Lead aprons**: Wear during procedures
- **Distance**: Stand behind barriers when possible
- **Monitoring**: Wear radiation badges
- **Training**: Regular radiation safety education

## üìä Image Quality Factors

### **Contrast**:
- Difference between light and dark areas
- Higher kVp = lower contrast
- Lower kVp = higher contrast

### **Density**:
- Overall darkness of image
- Higher mAs = darker image
- Lower mAs = lighter image

### **Detail/Sharpness**:
- Clarity of image edges
- Affected by motion, focal spot size
- Patient cooperation important

### **Distortion**:
- Misrepresentation of object size/shape
- Affected by positioning, beam angle
- Minimize through proper technique

## üß™ Today's Practice Exercise

**X-ray Production Quiz** (10 minutes):
1. What are the three main factors that control X-ray production?
2. Which interaction is most important for creating image contrast?
3. What does ALARA stand for?
4. How do you protect yourself from radiation exposure?

**Image Analysis** (15 minutes):
Look at sample X-ray images and identify:
- Which tissues appear white, gray, and black
- Why different tissues have different appearances
- How you could improve image quality

**Safety Scenarios** (5 minutes):
- What would you do if a patient moved during exposure?
- How would you position yourself during a chest X-ray?
- What protective equipment should you wear?

## üìù Key Terms to Remember

- **X-ray**: High-energy electromagnetic radiation
- **kVp**: Kilovoltage peak (controls X-ray energy)
- **mA**: Milliamperage (controls X-ray quantity)
- **mAs**: Milliampere-seconds (total exposure)
- **Photoelectric Effect**: Primary interaction for image formation
- **ALARA**: As Low As Reasonably Achievable

1. **Pneumonitis**
   - Pneumo = lung
   - -itis = inflammation
   - **Meaning**: Inflammation of the lung

2. **Osteoarthritis**
   - Osteo = bone
   - Arthr = joint
   - -itis = inflammation
   - **Meaning**: Inflammation of bone and joint

3. **Cardiomegaly**
   - Cardio = heart
   - -megaly = enlargement
   - **Meaning**: Enlarged heart

4. **Hepatosplenomegaly**
   - Hepato = liver
   - Spleno = spleen
   - -megaly = enlargement
   - **Meaning**: Enlarged liver and spleen

## üìö Abbreviations You'll See

### Common Medical Abbreviations:
- **CXR** = Chest X-ray
- **KUB** = Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder
- **PA** = Posterior-Anterior (X-ray view)
- **AP** = Anterior-Posterior (X-ray view)
- **LAT** = Lateral (side view)
- **OBL** = Oblique (angled view)

### Body Part Abbreviations:
- **R** = Right
- **L** = Left

## üß™ Today's Practice Exercise

**Term Building** (15 minutes):
Create medical terms using the prefixes, roots, and suffixes you learned:

1. Inflammation of the liver = _______________
2. Disease of the kidney = _______________
3. Enlargement of the heart = _______________
4. Study of bones = _______________
5. Pain in the joint = _______________

**Term Analysis** (10 minutes):
Break down these complex terms:
1. **Gastroenteritis** = _______________
2. **Osteomyelitis** = _______________
3. **Pneumothorax** = _______________
4. **Cardiovascular** = _______________

**Flashcard Creation** (5 minutes):
- Create 5 flashcards with medical terms
- Write the term on one side, meaning on the other
- Practice reading them aloud

## üìù Key Terms to Remember

- **Prefix**: Word part at the beginning

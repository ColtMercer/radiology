# Day 2: Basic Anatomy and Physiology

**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Topic**: Understanding the Human Body - Foundation for Radiology

## üéØ Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you will:
- Understand basic body systems and their functions
- Learn anatomical terminology and directional terms
- Identify major bones and organs visible on X-rays
- Understand how different tissues appear on imaging

## ü¶¥ The Skeletal System

The skeleton is our body's framework and is often the primary focus of X-ray imaging.

### Major Bone Groups:
1. **Skull**: Protects the brain
2. **Vertebral Column**: Spine (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, coccyx)
3. **Ribs**: Protect heart and lungs
4. **Upper Extremities**: Shoulder, arm, forearm, hand
5. **Lower Extremities**: Hip, thigh, leg, foot

### Why Bones Show Up Well on X-rays:
- **Dense tissue**: Absorbs X-rays, appears white
- **High contrast**: Easy to distinguish from soft tissues
- **Clear structure**: Bones have distinct shapes and patterns

## ü´Å The Respiratory System

### Key Structures:
- **Lungs**: Two large organs for gas exchange
- **Trachea**: Windpipe connecting throat to lungs
- **Bronchi**: Airways branching into lungs
- **Diaphragm**: Muscle separating chest from abdomen

### On X-rays:
- **Lungs**: Appear dark (air-filled)
- **Heart**: Appears as white shadow in center
- **Ribs**: White bony structures around lungs
- **Diaphragm**: Curved line at bottom of chest

## ‚ù§Ô∏è The Cardiovascular System

### Heart Chambers:
- **Right Atrium**: Receives blood from body
- **Right Ventricle**: Pumps blood to lungs
- **Left Atrium**: Receives blood from lungs
- **Left Ventricle**: Pumps blood to body

### On Chest X-rays:
- **Heart shadow**: White area in center of chest
- **Great vessels**: Aorta, pulmonary arteries
- **Cardiac silhouette**: Overall heart shape and size

## üß† The Nervous System

### Brain and Spinal Cord:
- **Brain**: Protected by skull
- **Spinal Cord**: Runs through vertebral column
- **Nerves**: Branch throughout body

### Imaging Considerations:
- **CT/MRI**: Better for brain and spinal cord
- **X-rays**: Limited for soft tissue like brain
- **Spine X-rays**: Show vertebral alignment and fractures

## ü´Ä The Digestive System

### Key Organs:
- **Esophagus**: Food tube to stomach
- **Stomach**: Food digestion
- **Liver**: Largest internal organ
- **Intestines**: Small and large intestine

### On Abdominal X-rays:
- **Gas patterns**: Help identify problems
- **Organ shadows**: Liver, spleen visible
- **Bowel loops**: Intestinal patterns

## üìê Anatomical Terminology

### Directional Terms:
- **Anterior/Posterior**: Front/back
- **Superior/Inferior**: Above/below
- **Medial/Lateral**: Toward/away from center
- **Proximal/Distal**: Closer to/farther from trunk

### Body Planes:
- **Sagittal**: Divides body into left/right
- **Coronal**: Divides body into front/back
- **Transverse**: Divides body into top/bottom

## üé® How Different Tissues Appear on X-rays

### **Air** (lungs, stomach):
- **Appearance**: Very dark/black
- **Reason**: X-rays pass through easily

### **Fat**:
- **Appearance**: Dark gray
- **Reason**: Low density, some X-ray absorption

### **Muscle/Organs**:
- **Appearance**: Medium gray
- **Reason**: Moderate density

### **Bone**:
- **Appearance**: White
- **Reason**: High density, absorbs most X-rays

### **Metal/Contrast**:
- **Appearance**: Very white
- **Reason**: Highest density, blocks X-rays

## üß™ Today's Practice Exercise

**Anatomy Quiz** (15 minutes):
1. Name the four chambers of the heart
2. What color do bones appear on X-rays and why?
3. List three directional terms and their meanings
4. What body system is most commonly imaged with X-rays?

**Visual Learning** (10 minutes):
- Look at sample chest X-ray images online
- Identify: lungs, heart, ribs, diaphragm
- Note the different shades of gray/white

**Drawing Exercise** (5 minutes):
- Draw a simple stick figure
- Label: head, neck, chest, abdomen, arms, legs
- Add arrows showing: anterior, posterior, superior, inferior

## üìù Key Terms to Remember

- **Anatomy**: Study of body structure
- **Physiology**: Study of body function
- **Anterior**: Front of body
- **Posterior**: Back of body
- **Superior**: Above, toward head
- **Inferior**: Below, toward feet
- **Medial**: Toward center of body
- **Lateral**: Away from center of body

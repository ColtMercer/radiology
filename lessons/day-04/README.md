**Topic**: Professional Patient Care - Communication, Safety, and Ethics

## üéØ Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you will:
- Understand the importance of professional patient communication
- Learn patient safety protocols and infection control
- Master proper patient positioning and comfort
- Understand patient rights and confidentiality

## üí¨ Professional Communication

### The 5 C's of Communication:
1. **Clear**: Use simple, understandable language
2. **Concise**: Get to the point efficiently
3. **Complete**: Provide all necessary information
4. **Courteous**: Always be respectful and kind

- Confirm understanding: "Do you have any questions?"

#### **Non-Verbal Communication**:
- Maintain appropriate eye contact
- Use open body language
- Smile genuinely
- Listen actively (nod, lean forward)

#### **Patient Instructions**:
```
"Mrs. Johnson, I'm going to take an X-ray of your chest. 
I'll need you to stand against this board and take a deep breath 
when I tell you. The procedure will take about 5 minutes. 
Do you have any questions?"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Patient Safety

### **ALARA Principle**:
- **A**s **L**ow **A**s **R**easonably **A**chievable
- Always minimize radiation exposure
- Use proper shielding and collimation
- Only image what's necessary

### **Infection Control**:
- **Hand Hygiene**: Wash hands before and after patient contact
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**:
  - Gloves when touching patients
  - Masks if patient has respiratory symptoms
  - Gowns if needed for isolation
- **Equipment Cleaning**: Disinfect surfaces between patients

### **Patient Identification**:
- **Two-Patient Identifier Rule**:
  1. Ask patient's full name
  2. Ask date of birth
  3. Check wristband if available
- **Never rely on room numbers alone**

## üë• Patient Rights and Privacy

### **HIPAA Compliance**:
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**
- Protect patient privacy at all times
- Don't discuss patients in public areas
- Secure patient information

### **Patient Rights**:
- **Right to Information**: Know what procedure is being done
- **Right to Refuse**: Can decline any procedure
- **Right to Privacy**: Modesty and dignity maintained
- **Right to Safety**: Safe, clean environment

### **Cultural Sensitivity**:
- Respect different cultural beliefs
- Ask about preferences for modesty
- Be aware of religious considerations
- Use appropriate language and gestures

## üè• Patient Positioning and Comfort

### **General Positioning Principles**:
- **Comfort First**: Patient should be as comfortable as possible
- **Stability**: Ensure patient won't fall or move unexpectedly
- **Accessibility**: Body part being imaged should be easily accessible
- **Radiation Safety**: Minimize exposure to patient and staff

### **Common Positions**:
- **Supine**: Lying on back
- **Prone**: Lying on stomach
- **Lateral**: Lying on side
- **Erect**: Standing
- **Semi-erect**: Sitting up

### **Patient Comfort Tips**:
- Provide pillows for support
- Use blankets for warmth
- Explain what you're doing before touching
- Check if patient needs bathroom break
- Offer assistance for mobility issues

## üö® Emergency Situations

### **Recognizing Emergencies**:
- **Chest Pain**: Could indicate heart attack
- **Difficulty Breathing**: Respiratory distress
- **Severe Pain**: May need immediate attention
- **Altered Mental Status**: Confusion, unconsciousness

### **Emergency Response**:
1. **Stay Calm**: Your calmness helps the patient
2. **Call for Help**: Use emergency button or call code
3. **Basic Life Support**: Know CPR if certified
4. **Document**: Record what happened and when

## üìã Patient Assessment

### **Pre-Procedure Assessment**:
- **Allergies**: Especially to contrast media
- **Pregnancy**: Always ask women of childbearing age
- **Recent Surgery**: May affect positioning
- **Pain Level**: Current pain and limitations
- **Mobility**: Can patient move independently?

### **Vital Signs Awareness**:
- **Blood Pressure**: High or low readings
- **Heart Rate**: Too fast or slow
- **Temperature**: Fever or hypothermia
- **Oxygen Saturation**: Breathing adequacy

## üß™ Today's Practice Exercise

**Communication Role-Play** (15 minutes):
Practice these scenarios with a friend or family member:

1. **Scenario 1**: Explaining a chest X-ray to an elderly patient
2. **Scenario 2**: Working with a patient who doesn't speak English well
3. **Scenario 3**: Calming a nervous child before an X-ray

**Safety Checklist** (10 minutes):
Create a checklist for patient safety:
- [ ] Patient identification verified
- [ ] Allergies checked
- [ ] Pregnancy status confirmed
- [ ] Proper positioning achieved
- [ ] Radiation protection in place

**Emergency Response Plan** (5 minutes):
- List 3 emergency situations you might encounter
- Write down the steps you would take for each
- Identify who you would call for help

## üìù Key Terms to Remember

- **ALARA**: As Low As Reasonably Achievable
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **PPE**: Personal Protective Equipment
- **Supine**: Lying on back
- **Prone**: Lying on stomach
